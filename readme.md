But, lucky for you, as you run from one of these powerful trees, you come across a room deep within the temple where you discover a staff with incredible power. With this staff in hand, you now have the power of the great tree and must use your wit and cunning to navigate the temple, solve puzzles, and defeat enemies on your quest to escape.
